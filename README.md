Work in progress, still searching for proper visual theme/aesthetic.

Look forward to having more impressive/sophisticated repos and projects to have on their.

I wrote two sections that are currently commented out, one for my music and one for my photography. I don't know how I feel yet about having all three psuedo-professions on one site, or if they should be seperate. Still working that one out.

Pretty happy about the functionality behind the site, particularly fond of the machinery governing the hover events.

Intentionally didn't add email and phone #. don't need the bots scrubbing that stuff
